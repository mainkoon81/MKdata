    "# Keep The Best Models During Training With Checkpointing\n",
    "Deep learning models can take hours, days or even weeks to train and if a training run is stopped unexpectedly, you can lose a lot of work. Discover how you can checkpoint your deep learning models during training, using the Keras library.\n",
    "- checkpoint each improvement \n",
    "- checkpoint the very best model \n",
    "\n",
    "Application checkpointing is a fault tolerance technique for long running processes. It is an approach where a snapshot of the state of the system is taken in case of system failure. If there is a problem, not all is lost. The checkpoint may be used directly, or used as the starting point for a new run, picking up where it left oﬀ. When training deep learning models, the checkpoint captures the weights of the model. These weights can be used to make predictions as-is, or used as the basis for ongoing training. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Keras library provides a checkpointing capability by a callback **API**. The **ModelCheckpoint** callback class allows you to deﬁne where to checkpoint the model **weights**, how the ﬁle should be **named** and under what **circumstances** to make a checkpoint of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **API** allows you to specify which **metric** to monitor, such as loss or accuracy on the training or validation dataset. You can specify whether to look for an improvement in maximizing or minimizing the score. Finally, the **ﬁlename** that you use to store the weights can include variables like the **epoch** number or **metric**. The ModelCheckpoint instance can then be passed to the training process when calling the **`fit()`** function on the model. Note, you may need to install the **h5py** library."
